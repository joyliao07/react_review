Public Folder - index.html:
    This will be the only html file in the web app. If you're making a multi-page web app,
    you will simply run <create-react-app (app-name)> to add pages; you will never manually add another html file.

Src Folder - App.js:
    This is where you nest all the sub-components to the app.

React.createElement():
    It takes three arguments:
        1. The element you will render to the DOM,
        2. An JS object as the configuration, and
        3. Any number of children
