They don’t run on the server; they run in the browser. We don’t have to wait for the server to respond to get a new page.


Reusable components


Add libraries:
React: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/15.6.1/react.min.js 
React DOM: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/15.6.1/react-dom.min.js 

    JS Preprocessor:
	    Babel - Babel let us use HTML5 syntax in JS.


Single Page Applications:
    - Only 1 HTML page; content is (re)rendered
    - Typically only 1 ReactDOM.render() call
	
Multi Page Applications:
    - Multiple HTML page; content is (re)rendered on server
    - One ReactDOM.render() call per "widget"
