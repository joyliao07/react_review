                                Tools & Packages


- Use Dependency Management Tool: npm or yarn
- Use Bundler: Webpack
- Use Compiler (next-gen JS): Babel + Presets
- Use a Development Server 


To Create New App:
    <create-react-app (app-name)>

Common Command Lines:
    <npm start>
    <npm run build>
    <npm test>

To Start:
    <npm start>

Public Folder - index.html:
    This will be the only html file in the web app. If you're making a multi-page web app,
    you will simply run <create-react-app (app-name)> to add pages; you will never manually add another html file.

Src Folder - App.js:
    This is where you nest all the sub-components to the app.

React.createElement():
    It takes three arguments:
        1. The element you will render to the DOM,
        2. An JS object as the configuration, and
        3. Any number of children

"state" from extends Component:
    <state> is a special JS object managed from inside the Component class (while <props> are hard-coded variables passed from the outside).  

"this.setState" from extends Component:
    <this.setState> is a special JS method managed from inside the Component class. It allows you to change the state, such as when a onClick function is called. <this.setState> will merge the new components to the old ones.

"useState" from React:
    <useState> returns a variable of two componenets: 1) the object themselves, and 2) the method to reset the object.

    Different from <this.setState> , when you reset the properties with <useState>, the new properties will replace the old properties. They do not merge.

    Secondly, you can call <useState> method as many times as you want, while <this.setState> can be called only once in the class.

Stateful vs Stateless:
    A stateful component is one that uses the "state", no matter it uses the state hook or the class-based approach of the state property. They are called "smart" or "container" components.

    A file such as <person.js> is a stateless component because it has no internal state management. As a result, they are called "dumb" or "presentational components". It is the preferred way of building components.

Radium:
    <npm install --save radium>
    Radium is a React package that allows us to use inline styling with sudo-selectors and media queries.
    1. <import Radium from  'radium'>
    2. Wrap all export components inside Radium()
    3. <import {StyleRoot} from 'radium'>
    4. In App.js, wrap what's inside <return> in <StyleRoot></StyleRoot>

CSS Modules:
    To use CSS modules, we actually need to tweak the built configuration of our project. <react-script> is the package that exposes the whole built workflow to us. We should never manually add and remove components from node_modules, because everytime we run <npm install>, the changes will be overwritten.
    
    Run <npm run eject> to unlock CSS modules.

    <git add .>
    <git commit -m "all changes need to be committed before running npm eject">
    <npm run eject> When you run this commnad, it gives you access to all config files.
    
    Modify the setting of <test: cssRegex> in file <webpack.config.js>

    In .js files, <import (name) from './App.css';>. And call the css objects as className.

    Run <npm start> to see updated styling.
