To Create New App:

Public Folder - index.html:
    This will be the only html file in the web app. If you're making a multi-page web app,
    you will simply run <create-react-app (app-name)> to add pages; you will never manually add another html file.

Src Folder - App.js:
    This is where you nest all the sub-components to the app.

React.createElement():
    It takes three arguments:
        1. The element you will render to the DOM,
        2. An JS object as the configuration, and
        3. Any number of children

"state" from extends Component:
    <state> is a special JS object managed from inside the Component class (while <props> are hard-coded variables passed from the outside).  

"this.setState" from extends Component:
    <this.setState> is a special JS method managed from inside the Component class. It allows you to change the state, such as when a onClick function is called.
